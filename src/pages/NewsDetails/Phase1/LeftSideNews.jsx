            On Oct. 7, 2023, when the scale of Hamas’s massacre in Israel became
            clear, we went to war. The pain for those of us in the military was
            unbearable. The feeling that we had failed to protect our loved ones
            consumed me. Fueled by anger and guilt, we entered combat against a
            ruthless terror organization that showed with brutal clarity the
            depths of its cruelty.
          </p>
          <p>
            I fought in Gaza for a year, first as a tank platoon commander and
            then as the deputy to my company commander. I led ground maneuvers
            inside the Gaza Strip, took Hamas strongholds and helped dismantle
            the group’s tunnels, weapons depots and command posts. Day by day,
            driven by duty, I confronted the stark reality of war: death and
            destruction at close range, the weight of irreversible decisions,
            the constant demand to act with clarity under fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            As time passed, another harsh truth emerged: Our own state had lost
            its way. If we went to war on Oct. 7 to save what was dearest to us,
            it soon became clear to me that we were fighting because our leaders
            were never planning to stop. It was a war waged by nationalist
            populists who refused to pay the political price necessary to make
            the decisions to bring an end to the war, and instead demanded that
            we, the soldiers, the hostages and the Palestinians, pay it in
            blood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gaza became a lawless zone, with little effective oversight of the
            military and almost no personal accountability for soldiers. We came
            to wage a war without a timeline, without attainable goals, without
            an exit strategy — a status quo that undermines the idea of a modern
            state.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Oct. 9, 2024, a group of Israel Defense Force soldiers, including
            me, issued a public letter declaring that our service had become
            untenable in light of Israel’s policy in Gaza and mounting evidence
            that the government was deliberately sabotaging hostage deals. My
            brigade commander immediately suspended me from my unit, despite the
            protests of my subordinate soldiers.

            Today, as the government calls on tens of thousands of reservists to
            participate in the cruel re-occupation of Gaza City, I implore my
            fellow soldiers: Refuse to report. Thousands have already stopped
            showing up. Some have been sent to prison. Many remain silent. This
            is the time to speak. It is your duty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone who cares about Israel’s future must understand that what
            is at stake is not only lives but also the very idea of Israel
            itself. If we continue on this path and take permanent control over
            Gaza, nothing will remain of the fragile vision of a liberal
            democracy that once defined this state. Under a reckless
            nationalist-populist government that denies the limits of its own
            power, Israel has no sustainable future. Everyone who loves Israel,
            a country that once knew how to survive the impossible, must do all
            in their power to steer us away from this collision course.
          </p>
          <p>
            Public refusal of military service is an almost unthinkable act in
            Israeli society, given the central place of the army in our national
            identity and how it shapes who we are as individuals. But my belief
            is basic to any democracy: Military power is an important tool, but
            a dangerous one. It is meant to serve political goals, not replace
            them. The moment force becomes an end in itself, it brings only
            destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plan to reoccupy Gaza City is not a measured military move but a
            symptom of an addiction to occupation by a government that knows
            only how to destroy, not build.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement last week about
            returning the Israeli team to the negotiating table was part of a
            familiar pattern. Every time public protest intensifies, he declares
            progress or a return to talks — only to let the process collapse
            again. The real question is why Israel ever leaves the table in the
            first place. Why are we being led instead of leading?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Israeli government keeps selling the public an empty goal —
            “total victory” — as if it were strategy rather than marketing.
            Anyone with open eyes knows it is a lie. Hamas as a governing or
            military organization has long been defeated; I bet every senior
            security official knows this Most Israelis , among them many
            active-duty soldiers, oppose this reckless course — including the
            I.D.F. chief of staff, who has openly voiced his opposition to
            reoccupying Gaza.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is clear to all that this war will end with a deal. Every delay
            brings more casualties, more likelihood that hostages will not
            return alive and further erosion of Israel’s position with mediators
            and international partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Against this populism, against a government without a moral or
            political mandate to lead Israel, only public protest — especially
            by military reservists — can help force a change of course. Moments
            of national crisis have given rise to refusal movements that
            ultimately helped push societies to confront disastrous policies.
            They demonstrate that only those willing to pay a personal price to
            expose the lie can truly fight for the truth. It happened before in
            Israel, during the 1982 Lebanon war and the 2000-5 second intifada,
            and in the United States during the Vietnam War. Ministers pay no
            price. We, the soldiers, and so many others, do pay.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a Zionist. Israel has a right to repel its antagonists. I am
            not a pacifist and do not regret fighting. But precisely for that
            reason, I now understand this: To be brave today means to stop, to
            say, “No more.” With over 60,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians,
            dead, according to Gazan health authorities, and growing starvation
            in the territory, with Israeli hostages languishing for nearly two
            years, this war has crossed every boundary. There is no longer any
            goal worth achieving by prolonging the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every Zionist who believes in a Jewish and democratic state, every
            citizen who believes in the values for which we went to fight, must
            grasp that the responsibility is in our hands. Now is the time to
            say no to cooperation. No to silent consent. Refusing to serve is
            not betrayal of the state. Refusing is the only way to save it.
